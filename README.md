# ðŸ§© Problem Statement

Automated Cricket Video Analysis System Utilizing Computer Vision

**Background:**

In cricket, performance analysis often requires manual review of hours of match footage to evaluate player techniques, shot types, and key events. This is time-consuming and prone to human error, especially when trying to gather statistics on player strengths, weaknesses, and dismissals. With advancements in computer vision and deep learning, it's possible to automate this process for faster, more accurate insights.

**Problem:**

There is no accessible, automated system that can detect players and ball movement, classify shot types, and generate insights and highlights from raw cricket footage, especially in varied video conditions. Analysts and coaches need a tool that can process videos efficiently and provide actionable performance metrics.

**Objective:**

To develop a computer vision-based system that detects players and ball movement in cricket videos, classifies shot types, tracks performance, and automatically generates highlight clips, enabling deeper player analysis with minimal manual effort.

## ðŸ“„ Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

### 1. **Introduction**

**1.1 Purpose**

This document defines the software requirements for an automated cricket video analysis system. It provides details on functionality, interfaces, and design constraints for developing a solution that extracts meaningful analytics from cricket match footage using computer vision techniques.

**1.2 Scope**

The software will detect players and balls in cricket footage, classify shots, track outcomes, and generate performance metrics and highlight clips. It will provide APIs to integrate with a frontend dashboard for coaches, analysts, and players.

**1.3 Definitions**

- **Shot Classification**: Identifying the type of batting shot played (e.g., pull, drive).
- **Object Tracking**: Monitoring the movement of players and the ball across frames.
- **Highlight Generation**: Extracting short video clips around detected key actions.
